Welcome to PromptSandbox, a user-friendly platform designed to help you effortlessly create powerful workflows 
using OpenAI APIs. There's no need for 10 years of coding experience, as you can simply build your 
workflows by dragging and dropping nodes and connecting them.

In this guide, you will discover how to utilize our primary features. Here&apos;s a summary of the
process:
## Summary
1. Begin by choosing a node relevant to your use case and place it in the
sandbox. Each node performs a specific function. <a className="cursor-pointer" onClick={() => props.setPage('Nodes')}>Consult this page</a> for a
list of available nodes.
